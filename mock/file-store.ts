/**
 * The one thing the mock backend needs from whatever it is running on: a flat
 * store of small text documents, addressed by path.
 *
 * `store.ts` used to call `node:fs` directly, which pinned the mock to the Vite
 * dev server. Behind this interface the same store runs in two places - files
 * under `server-data/` while you develop (see `server/node_file-store.ts`) and
 * IndexedDB when the built app is served as static files with no backend at
 * all (see `browser_backend.ts`). The paths are identical in both, so what the
 * UI reports as `server-data/translations/web/school/vi.json` names the same
 * document either way.
 *
 * Reads and writes are synchronous because every caller in `store.ts` is, and
 * a backend that has to be awaited would turn one screen's worth of lookups
 * into a promise chain. The browser implementation keeps its documents in
 * memory and persists them behind the caller's back.
