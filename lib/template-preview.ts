/**
 * Turning a template field into something that can be rendered as the reader
 * will see it.
 *
 * Two jobs, both needed before a preview pane is honest:
 *
 * 1. **Placeholders.** `Hi {name}, your code is {code}` previewed literally
 *    tells a translator nothing about length or word order. Sample values are
 *    substituted so the preview reads as a real message, and the sample for
 *    each placeholder is longer than the English word it replaces, because a
 *    name is where a layout actually breaks.
 * 2. **HTML.** An email body is markup, and the point of the pane is to render
 *    it. Rendering translator-supplied markup as-is would put whatever a
 *    bundle contains into this document, so the body is escaped first and only
 *    an explicit whitelist of tags is reintroduced - see `safeHtml`.
