/**
 * Reading an uploaded language file, and working out what importing it would
 * change.
 *
 * Pure, and deliberately separate from the dialog that shows it: the preview
 * the reviewer accepts and the write the server performs have to agree about
 * what "replace" means, so the rule is written once here and once in
 * `src/mock/store.ts` against the same vocabulary - nothing is written until
 * the preview is accepted (see `docs/redesign_brief.md`, §3.7).
 *
 * A file may hold keys the registry has never heard of. Importing registers
 * them - `new` in the diff below - against the value the file carries, giving
 * every other language the same key and no text, exactly as `createKey` does.
 * A key whose name the registry cannot accept is the one thing still skipped,
 * and it is named rather than dropped quietly.
